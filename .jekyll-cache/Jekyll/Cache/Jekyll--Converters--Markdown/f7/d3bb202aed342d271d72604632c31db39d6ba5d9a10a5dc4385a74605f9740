I"y	<p>My name is Kieren Underwood. I was born into a fundamentalist doomsday cult. I left when I was 22. I studied Theology in the United States (Oklahoma). Then I studied Computer Science in Australia (Perth).</p>

<p>I’m interested in the history of Christianity, cults, philosophy of science, epistemology, evolutionary psychology, and people who changed their minds.</p>

<p>The person I’ve read most biographies about is Jesus of Nazareth, followed closely by Napoleon the Great—both of these are very regrettable. The book I’ve read the most times is <em>The Closing of the American Mind</em> by Allan Bloom. My favourite non-fiction book is <em>Ideas: A History from Fire to Freud</em> by Peter Watson. My favourite fiction book is <em>Foucault’s Pendulum</em> by Umberto Eco. My favourite collection of short stories is <em>Selected Fictions</em> by Jorges Luis Borges. My favourite philosopher is Baruch Spinoza, despite his <em>Ethics</em> being ridiculous. My favourite author is Fyodor Dostoevsky. My favourite movie is <em>Magnolia</em> by Paul Thomas Anderson.</p>

<p>If I had to recommend ten books that would give you a sense of my worldview, they would be:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>I Am A Strange Loop</em> - Douglas Hofstadter</li>
  <li><em>The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy</em> - Douglas Adams</li>
  <li><em>Darwin’s Dangerous Idea: Evolution and the Meanings of Life</em> - Daniel Dennett</li>
  <li><em>The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable</em> - Nassim Taleb</li>
  <li><em>The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined</em> - Steven Pinker</li>
  <li><em>The Elephant in the Brain: Hidden Motives in Everyday Life</em> - Robin Hanson and Kevin Simler</li>
  <li><em>Rationality: From AI to Zombies</em> - Eliezer Yudkowsky</li>
  <li><em>Notes from the Underground</em> - Fyodor Dostoevsky</li>
  <li><em>Confessions of a Mask</em> - Yukio Mishima</li>
  <li><em>Constantine’s Sword: The Church and the Jews: A History</em> - James Carroll</li>
  <li><em>When Prophecy Fails</em> - Leon Festinger, Henry Riecken, and Stanley Schachter</li>
  <li><em>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</em> - Thomas Kuhn</li>
</ul>

<p>Ok, that was twelve.</p>

<p>I have other interests, like classical guitar, beach volleyball, and functional programming languages. They aren’t related to this blog.</p>
